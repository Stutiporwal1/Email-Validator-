        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>Welcome to <span class ="highlight" >iValidateE</span> - your reliable, real-time email validation solution. Our goal is to make email verification simple, fast, and secure for individuals, developers, and businesses.</p>

        <p>iValidate is built to help solve a common problem (that is not so common in the world) : users entering fake or invalid email addresses.</p>

         <p>
      What makes us different? We focus on <span class="highlight">privacy-first validation</span>. We don’t store or share any emails you check — everything runs in real time, ensuring fast results and total confidentiality.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our mission is to offer a lightweight, easy-to-use tool that fits into any workflow — from simple contact forms to professional SaaS platforms. We're always improving and listening to feedback to make iValidateE even better.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for using iValidateE. We're glad you're here!
